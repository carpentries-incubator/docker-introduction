::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Use existing container images and Docker in a research project.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I use Docker for my own work?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that we have learned the basics of working with Docker container images and containers,
let's apply what we learned to an example workflow.

You may choose one or more of the following examples to practice using containers.

## GitHub Actions Example

In this [GitHub Actions example](../instructors/e01-github-actions.md), you can learn more about
continuous integration in the cloud and how you can use container images with GitHub to
automate repetitive tasks like testing code or deploying websites.
